## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Isfa Farhan! While Iâ€™m not a full-stack developer just yet, I proudly consider myself a full-stack designer. I specialize in UI/UX design, illustrations, and simple animations. For me, development is another creative outletâ€”a way to flex my problem-solving skills and bring ideas to life through code.
